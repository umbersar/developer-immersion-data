## Check Installed Docker 

1. Open a new terminal window.

1. Check your docker installation  
1. Docker is already installed so you can start typing any Docker command, in this example we will check the installed Docker version:  
    
    ```cmd
        docker version
    ```
    ![Docker version](img/docker_version_cmd.png "Docker version")

    > This tell us Docker is really up and running!!

## Configure your installation

SQL Server on Linux needs, at least, ``3.8 GB of RAM`` available. So we need to make sure we assign this amount of RAM to our Docker configuration.

1. Right click on the Docker whale icon. 

    ![Docker whale trayicon](img/docker_whale_trayicon_selected.png "Docker whale trayicon")

1. Click on the ``Settings`` menu option.

1. Go to Advanced option  
    ![Docker Advanced settings default values](img/Docker_Settings_Advanced_DefaultValues.png "Docker Advanced settings default values")  
    
    > As you can see Docker, by default, set ``2 GB of RAM`` to be available for containers. So we need 
    to change this value to get the minimum necessary to run the SQL Server on Linux.

1. Increase amount of memory available for Docker containers.

    > In the screenshot we are showing you is the minimum memory needed to start up SQL Server 2016 on Linux
    > but we recommend giving it more RAM if it is available.

1. Click ``Apply & Restart`` button.  
    Docker will reinitialize with the new configuration values.  You must wait a bit until Docker
    applies the changes and restarts again with the updated values.
