CREATING A COLUMN TO STORE JSON INFORMATION
====

First we have to edit our current `Products` table to include a new column. This column will store the extra information we want to add about a particular videogame, in JSON format.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your SQL Server.

    The default SQL credentials are: experience1/P2ssw0rd@Dev.

2. Right click on the `Expenses` database and click *New query*

3. Copy and paste the following code, and execute it.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [Catalog].[Product]
    ADD AdditionalInformation NVARCHAR(max) NULL
    CONSTRAINT AdditionalInformationMustBeJson
    CHECK (ISJSON(AdditionalInformation) > 0)
    GO 
    ```
    
    This code will create an additional column. Notice that there is nothing strange in the code: the only thing that stands out is the constraint. We use one of the built-in functions of SQL Server to check that the text introduced is in JSON format. `ISJSON` returns 1 if the text contains valid JSON, and 0 otherwise. 

    Now that we have our new column, let's populate it with data. As we saw in the introduction, there are services available that provide a lot of information about videogames. For our example, we have used the [TheGamesDB](http://thegamesdb.net/). In the following snippet you can see the information that this API returns about the two existent games in the catalog: Dead Rising 3 and Forza Motorsport 5.

    *Dead Rising 3*

    Let's save this new information in the table.

4. Again, right click on the `Expenses` database and click *New query*

                    }

            }
        '
        WHERE [Title] = 'Dead Rising 3 for Xbox One'
        GO
    ```

6. Do the same with the following code, to update the Forza Motorsport 5 game.

    ```sql
    UPDATE [Catalog].[Product]
    SET [AdditionalInformation] = N'
    {
        "Data": {
            "baseImgUrl": "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/",

                },
                "Players": "4+",
                "Co-op": "No",
                "Youtube": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r46D1lRpO1k",

                "Developer": "Turn 10 Studios",
                "Rating": "9",
                "Images": {
                    "boxart": {
                        "-side": "front",
                        "-width": "1034",
                        "-height": "1344",

                        "#text": "boxart/original/front/17096-1.jpg"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    '
    WHERE [Title] = 'Forza motorsport 5'
    GO
    ```

7. If everything was correct, you should see the new data inserted in the new column created. You can check it executin the followin query:

    ```sql
        SELECT TOP(100) * FROM [Catalog].[Product]
    ```
