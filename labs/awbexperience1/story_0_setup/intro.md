SETUP

MyExpenses is an application that aims to provide a comprehensive expense tracking system for companies all over the world. Every employee can log expenses using the MyExpenses web portal and get them reimbursed in either cash or company points, which can be spent in the company store without leaving MyExpenses. Managers can do everything an employee can, but also review, approve or reject the expense reports submitted by team members. 


MyExpenses is built on top of a SQL Server 2016 database, with a frontend in AngularJS and a backend using Node.js. SQL Server allows us to easily scale the services offered to our clients and provide a good performance.
