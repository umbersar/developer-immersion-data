2. A new instance of Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition will be opened. It is a free edition of Visual Studio. Before using it, you will need to introduce your Microsoft account credentials. 

3. Once the project is loaded, in the right panel you should see the "Solution Explorer", where all the files contained in the project appear.
