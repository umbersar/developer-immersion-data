UPDATE CONNECTION STRING IN THE WEB APPLICATION
====

Once all the databases have been migrated to the Azure SQL Server, the only remaining step is to update the endpoints of our website, so it knows where to find the new databases.

1. Open the file "server\config\server.config.js". 

2. Inside the options node, update the host with the new one and also add the new "dialectOptions" node. This node is mandatory after the migration because the communication with Azure SQL Server is always encrypted:

    ```js
    options: {
            host: process.env.databaseServer || '{YOUR DATABASE DNS NAME HERE}',
            dialect: 'mssql',
            dialectOptions: {
                encrypt: true
            },
            pool: {
                max: 5,
                min: 0,
                idle: 10000
            }
        }
    ``` 

5. Save the file, and open the website. 

6.	Copy the website link, right click Internet Explorer and select "Start InPrivate Browsing". Paste the website link and then click on Sign In. You can use the following credentials:

    Normal user:

        Andrew.Davis@holexperiences.onmicrosoft.com

    Manager user:

        Robin.Count@holexperiences.onmicrosoft.com
        P2ssw0rd@User 

7.	After the login process, you should see everything without any issue!
