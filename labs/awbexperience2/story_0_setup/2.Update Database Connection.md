UPDATE DATABASE CONNECTION
====

By now you should have the DNS name of the Virtual Machine where the database has been deployed. You'll now update the connection string of the WebApplication to target the deployed database

1. In the "MyExpenses" solution, there is a project called "MyExpenses.Web", which is the web application project. Open it and update the `server.config.js` file that can be found in server\config

  ```js
    let config = {
        port: process.env.port || 8000,
        path: 'api',
        serverName: 'DemoExpenses',
        db: {
            userName: process.env.databaseUsername || 'experience2',
            password: process.env.databasePassword || 'P2ssw0rd@Dev',
            database: process.env.database || 'Expenses',
            options: {
                host: process.env.databaseServer || '{YOUR DATABASE DNS NAME HERE}',
                dialect: 'mssql',
                pool: {
                    max: 5,
                    min: 0,
                    idle: 10000
                }
            }
        }
    };
  ```

  Just update {YOUR DATABASE DNS NAME HERE} with the DNS Name that you have copied from last page.
