CREATING AZURE ML WORKSPACE
====

We'll start our work by creating an Azure ML workspace from the Azure portal.

1. First, login into the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com using your credentials

2. There is a *Machine Learning Workspace* created for you:

3. Optionaly, in a collaborative project, you can share this workspace with other users contributing in a predictive experiment

    From the deployed workspace select *Access Control (IAM)*. Then click Add.
