# Flight Delay analysis using Cosmos DB, Spark Cluster in HDInsight and Power BI

In this experience you will perfrom predicitive analytics by using Azure Cosmos DB, Spark Cluster in HDInsight and Interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Pre-requisites for the lab ###

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop 2.51.4885.701
- Microsoft R Open 3.4.2

### Introduction 
Consider the user scenario, authorized ground staff member from Airline industry wants to perform analysis regarding cancelled and delayed flights as these are most remembered performance indicators of any transportation system.
So, we will represent cancelled and delayed flight analysis in graphical format to the end user using **Cosmos DB, Spark Cluster in HDInsight** and **Interactive Power BI dashboard**.



### Provision the Azure Resources ###

1. Create the Azure resources.
    
  Simply click the Deploy to Azure button below and follow the wizard to create the resources. You will need to log in to the Azure Portal.
