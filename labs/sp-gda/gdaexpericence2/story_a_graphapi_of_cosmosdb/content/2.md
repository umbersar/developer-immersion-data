# Scenario 3: Graph plotting using Graph API (Gremlin Query) for Code Share and Solo Service Details by launching ContosoAir App

   > _Now lets move to our main scenario where we need to plot graph for the Code share and Solo Service details of selected flight._
   > _We will use ContosoAir demo app for displaying Code share and Solo Service details of selected flight in graphical format._
   > _Here you go!_

## Part A - Creating collections and inserting data in Cosmos DB using Data Migration Tool

   > _Now as we need to display the flight specific Codeshare and Solo Service details to the end user, we need to first add flight details in Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API).So, lets start inserting data related to flights and their specific seats in Cosmos DB by creating collections using Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)._

   > _Here, we will insert flight and seat details into Cosmos DB using_ **Microsoft's Data Migration Tool.**

   For more details about the migration tool, click on the given link: [Data Migration tool.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/import-data)

1. Launch the **Data Migration Tool** by double clicking on **dtui.exe** ![](img/DtuiApp.png) file present on **Desktop**.

1. After the tool is launched, click on **Source Information** menu present on the left panel.
1. Select **JSON file(s)** option from **Import from** dropdown.
1. Click on **Add Files** button.
1. Select the JSON file **FlightsCollection.json** present at the location **C:\source\experience2\PayloadData** and click **Open** button.
1. Then click **Next button** to redirect to **Target information** menu.
1. Now, switch to **Azure Portal** in which you are already logged in from Part B of scenario1.
1. Navigate to Azure Portal's **Resource Group** option present in the favorites menu on the left side panel and select your Resource **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>** and click on Azure Cosmos DB Account **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDbAcc"/>**.
1. Go to **Keys** option under **Azure Cosmos DB account blade** and copy the **Primary Connection String.**

   ![](img/KeysPage.png)

1. Switch back to **Data Migration Tool** already launched in step 1.
1. Paste the copied **Primary Connection String** in **Connection String** text box and append with **Database Name** at the end of the string in **Target information** option.

   **For e.g.**
   AccountEndpoint= https://t-2.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=your\primary\key==;Database= Your Cosmos DB Account Name;.
   >**Note**: Here your database name is <inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDbAcc"/>

   ![](img/DataMigrationToolPage.png)

1. Once you are done with the Step 11, click on **Verify** button next to **Connection String** field to verify the connection string.
1. On successful verification of Connection string, success pop-up window will be displayed, then click on **OK** button.
1. On verification failure of connection string, a pop-up window will appear prompting the **failure message** , then click on **Ok** button and again verify the connection string with valid details till successful verification.
1. Enter the Collection Name **FlightsCollection** in **Collection** field.
1. Click on **Next** button. Ignore the **Advanced configuration** window and click **Next** button. Then, click on **Import** button to import the data present in **Json** file into **Cosmos DB collection.**
1. This will start the data uploading process. Wait for some time to complete the process and once the process is completed successfully, click on **New Import** button ![](img/NewImportButton.png).Now you will get pop up window displaying â€“ **Do you want to reset import settings?**

   ![](img/NewImportPopUp.png)

1. Click on **Yes** button and you will again be redirected to **Source Information page** of **Data Migration Tool**.

   > _Congrats you have successfully uploaded Flights data in Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API) by creating collection._

   > _Now again we need to create collection for adding Seat's details in Cosmos DB. Lets now create collection for Seats details data uploading._

1. Select **JSON file(s)** option from **Import from** dropdown present on Source Information page of Data Migration Tool.
1. Click on **Add Files** button.
1. Select the JSON file **SeatsCollection.json** present at the location **C:\source\experience2\PayloadData** and click **Open** button.
1. Then click **Next button** to redirect to **Target information** menu.
1. Now, switch to **Azure Portal** in which you are already logged in from Part B of scenario1.
1. Navigate to Azure Portal's **Resource Group** option present in the favorites menu on the left side panel and select your Resource **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>** and click on Azure Cosmos DB Account **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDbAcc"/>**.
1. Go to **Keys** option under **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade and **copy** the **Primary Connection String.**

   ![](img/KeysPage.png)

1. Switch back to **Data Migration Tool** which is already launched.
1. Paste the copied **Primary Connection String** in **Connection String** text box and append with **Database Name** at the end of the string in **Target information** option.

    **For e.g**
     AccountEndpoint=https://t-2.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=your_primary_key==;Database=Your Cosmos DB Account Name.
   >**Note** : Here your database name is <inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDbAcc"/>.
    
   ![](img/DataMigrationToolPage.png)

1. Once you are done with this Step, click on **Verify** button next to **Connection String** field to verify the connection string.

   > _Now we have data related to flights and seats present in Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API), whereas Codeshare and Solo service related data is already present in Azure Cosmos graph DB API._

   > _To accomplish our main scenario, we need to connect ContosoAir app with these databases present in Resource group named <inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence2/story_a_graphapi_of_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/> as we need to display Codeshare and Solo Service details in graphical format._

   > _So, lets start using Service; the middle layer, which will provide communication in your Cosmos DB and ContosoAir application._
