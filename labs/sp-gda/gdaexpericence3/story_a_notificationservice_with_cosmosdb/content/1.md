	"total_score": "@variables('Total_Score')"
    }

   ```

   >  **NOTE:** The code snippet contains **JSON** body which we are passing to **Azure function**.
   >  It includes:
   >- **review_count** – To represent total reviews.
   >- **@length(triggerBody())** - To place total reviews count in JSON body.
   >- **total_score** – to calculate sum of all reviews.
   >- **@variable('Total_Score')** - To Place Total_score value in JSON body.

    var review_count = data.review_count;
    var average_score = parseFloat(total_score)/parseFloat(review_count);
    //Response of the function to be used later.
    context.res = {
    body:  average_score
    };
    context.done();
    };
   ```

   > **NOTE** : This code snippet of **Azure function** is responsible to calculate the **average score** by accepting **total_score** and **review_count** from input data object. The calculated **average score** **(average_score)** will be returned in the body with the help of context object.

1. Click on **Create** button then on **Save** button appearing on the top.

        string serialized = await Task.Run(() => JsonConvert.SerializeObject(Reviews, _serializerSettings));
	
        HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.PostAsync(GetSoloServiceReviewUrl, new StringContent(serialized, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));

        await HandleResponse(response);

        string responseData = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

        return await Task.Run(() => (responseData));
    }
   ```
   >This Function will retrieve the information along with ratings of staff serving the Flying Solo Service from Logic App.
   > **NOTE**:
   >- The **GetReviewScore** method is responsible for calling the Logic App and to get the average score. It accepts **List of Reviews** as an input parameter and returns string containing the average score.
   >- The **List of Reviews** converted into **JSON** are stored into the **serialized** string variable using **JsonConvert.SerializeObject()** method.
   >- The method **httpClient.PostAsync()** which accepts 2 parameters viz. first -**Logic App url(GetSoloServiceReviewUrl)** and second - **StringContent** object having **JSON** input data serialized, encoding format (Encoding.UTF8) and data type ("application/json").
   >- After getting response in **responseData** variable with the help of **ReadAsStringAsync()** method, the data will get returned into calling method.

1. Now go to **ViewModels** folder under **ContosoAir.Clients.Core** project, click on it to expand and double click on **SoloServiceViewModel.cs** file.
1. Add below code after line number **65** at line number **66** in **InitializeAsync(object navigationData)** method and press **Ctrl+S** button from the keyboard to save the changes.

   ```
   >This function will display the information of source staff serving the Flying Solo Service.

   > **NOTE** : Here we are setting property **Source_SoloService_Score**, by calling **GetReviewScore()** method which accepts **Reviews** as input parameter and return average score(from 0 -1 floating number). Returned score will be converted into floating number and will be multiplied by 5 for plotting reviews in the form of star ratings on UI.

1. Add below code after line number **85** at line number **86** in the else part, and press **Ctrl+S** button from the keyboard to **Save** the changes in the code.

   ```C#
   var Dest_SoloService_Score = await _soloServiceProvider.GetReviewScore(SS.Reviews);
   SoloService.Dest_SoloService_Score = float.Parse(Dest_SoloService_Score, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.NumberFormat) * 5;
   ```

   >This function will display the information of destination staff serving the Flying Solo Service.

   > **NOTE** : Here we are setting property **Dest_SoloService_Score**, by calling **GetReviewScore()** method which accepts Reviews as input parameter and return average score(from 0 -1 floating number). Returned score will be converted into floating number and will be multiplied by 5 for plotting reviews in the form of star ratings on UI.
